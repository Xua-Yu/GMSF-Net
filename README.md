# GMSF-Net

Version 1.0,  Copyright(c) December, 2025. 

This is the source code of our AAAI paper, "[Learning Topology-Driven Multi-Subspace Fusion for Grassmannian Deep Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08628)". 
This implementation is built upon the publicly available codes of **SPDBN** and **GDLNet**.. 
All the settings are consistent with the description in the main paper.
If you have any queries, please do not hesitate to contact me 6243114042@stu.jiangnan.edu.cn.

Usage:

Step 1: Download the preprocessed FPHA dataset from the [SymNet](https://github.com/GitWR/SymNet)

Step 2: Unzip the dataset into '.\data'.

Step 3: Launch FPHA.py for a simple example.
